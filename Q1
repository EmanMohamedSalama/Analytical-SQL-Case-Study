Q1

--we want to expand our business and analyse our store revenu to decide 
in which countries we shoud lunch new branches 
and in which countries we need to close our store to decrease our lose

--so first we need to rank our countries by the revenu  


select distinct country as country, sum (quantity*unitprice) as revenu,
        dense_rank () over (order by sum (quantity*unitprice) desc ) as rank
from online_retail
group by country
order by rank;


--now we need to break down to know highest and lowest revenu per each country


select distinct (country) as country,
        last_value (sum (quantity*unitprice)) over (partition by (country)
                    order by (sum (quantity*unitprice))
                    rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as highest_revnue,
        last_value (sum (quantity*unitprice)) over (partition by (country)
                    order by sum (quantity*unitprice) desc
                    rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as lowest_revnue
from online_retail
group by country,invoiceno;


-- so we need to focus more on the lowest contry and make our fast action due to this result

--lets know the country which have the highest and lowest number of customers to define the problem more 


select count (distinct customerid)as customer_count, country,
        dense_rank () over (order by count( distinct customerid) desc ) as rank
from online_retail
group by country;

--now we need to know how many costumer visit our store daily per country :

select count (distinct customerid) as customer_count, country, to_timestamp(invoicedate,'MM/DD/YYYY') as day_date,
          dense_rank () over (order by count( distinct customerid) desc) as rank
from online_retail
group by country,to_timestamp(invoicedate,'MM/DD/YYYY')
order by rank;


-- so we need to take our fast action regarding the country with the lowest rank 
--now we need to break down to know what is the highest product per each country 
--to ensure that we provide our branches with sutiable quantity with it

---highest product per each country

select distinct (description) as highest_product, country,
        last_value (count (description)) over (partition by (country)
                    order by (count (description))
                    rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as product_count
from online_retail
group by description, country;

-- now we can make our descions regading to our analysis results.
